morituri is a CD ripper aiming for accuracy over speed.
Its features are modeled to compare with Exact Audio Copy on Windows.


RATIONALE
---------
For a more detailed rationale, see my wiki page 'The Art of the Rip'
at https://thomas.apestaart.org/thomas/trac/wiki/DAD/Rip

FEATURES
--------
* support for MusicBrainz for metadata lookup
* support for AccurateRip verification
* detects sample read offset and ability to defeat cache of drives
* performs test and copy rip
* detects and rips Hidden Track One Audio
* templates for file and directory naming
* support for lossless encoding and lossy encoding or re-encoding of images
* tagging using GStreamer, including embedding MusicBrainz id's
* retagging of images
* plugins for logging
* for now, only a command line client (rip) is shipped

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- cdparanoia, for the actual ripping
- cdrdao, for session, TOC, pregap, and ISRC extraction
- GStreamer and its python bindings, for encoding
  - gst-plugins-base >= 0.10.22 for appsink
- python musicbrainz2, for metadata lookup
- python-setuptools, for plugin support
- python-cddb, for showing but not using disc info if not in musicbrainz
- pycdio, for drive identification (optional)

GETTING MORITURI
----------------
If you are building from a source tarball or checkout, you can choose to
use morituri installed or uninstalled.

- getting:
  - Change to a directory where you want to put the morituri source code
    (For example, $HOME/dev/ext or $HOME/prefix/src)
  - source: download tarball, unpack, and change to its directory
  - checkout:
    git clone git://github.com/thomasvs/morituri.git
    cd morituri
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ./autogen.sh

- building:
  ./configure
  make

- you can now choose to install it or run it uninstalled.
  - installing:
    make install
  - running uninstalled:
    ln -sf `pwd`/misc/morituri-uninstalled $HOME/bin/morituri-git
    morituri-git
    (this drops you in a shell where everything is set up to use morituri)

RUNNING MORITURI
----------------
morituri currently only has a command-line interface called 'rip'

rip is self-documenting.
rip -h gives you the basic instructions.

rip implements a tree of commands; for example, the top-level 'changelog'
command has a number of sub-commands.

Positioning of arguments is important;
  rip cd -d (device) rip
is correct, while
  rip cd rip -d (device)
is not, because the -d argument applies to the rip command.

Check the man page (rip(1)) for more information.


RUNNING UNINSTALLED
-------------------

To make it easier for developers, you can run morituri straight from the
source checkout:

./autogen.sh
make
misc/morituri-uninstalled

GETTING STARTED
---------------
The simplest way to get started making accurate rips is:

- pick a relatively popular CD that has a good change of being in the
  AccurateRip database
- find the drive's offset by running
  rip offset find
- wait for it to complete; this might take a while
- optionally, confirm this offset with two more discs
- analyze the drive's caching behaviour
  rip drive analyze
- rip the disc by running
  rip cd rip --offset (the number you got before)

FILING BUGS
-----------
morituri's bug tracker is at https://thomas.apestaart.org/morituri/trac/
When filing bugs, please run the failing command with the environment variable
RIP_DEBUG set; for example:

  RIP_DEBUG=5 rip offset find > morituri.log 2>&1
  gzip morituri.log

And attach the gzipped log file to your bug report.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
- no GUI yet

GOALS
-----
- quality over speed
- support one-command automatic ripping
- support offline ripping (doing metadata lookup and log rewriting later)
  - separate the info/result about the rip from the metadata/file generation/...
